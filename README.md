# GENIE3
GENIE3 (GEne Network Inference with Ensemble of trees) R-package



We recommend to **install** GENIE3 from [Bioconductor](https://bioconductor.org/packages/devel/bioc/html/GENIE3.html). This Github repository is meant mostly for development.

A **tutorial** [(vignette)](https://bioconductor.org/packages/devel/bioc/vignettes/GENIE3/inst/doc/GENIE3.html) is included in the package.


To install the development version, you can run the following commands from R:
```
install.packages("https://bioconductor.org/packages/devel/bioc/src/contrib/GENIE3_0.99.7.tar.gz", repos=NULL)

# You might need to install these packages first:
install.packages(c("stats", "reshape2"))
```
